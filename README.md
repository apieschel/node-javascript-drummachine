Based on, and inspired by, Mary Rose Cook's video of live coding a drum machine: http://drum-machine.maryrosecook.com/.

Ideas for recording functionality came from this HTML5 Drum Machine: https://html5drummachine.com/.

Allows users to Record drum loops in the browser, download them as .wav files, set tempo with an external midi clock, and upload their own drum samples.
